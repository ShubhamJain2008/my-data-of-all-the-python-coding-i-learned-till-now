#Lists:-
#list are bassically some numbers stored in a variable with square brackets with can be edited, printed.

#it is mutable(when one or more elements can be edited or changed).

Num_List = [2,8,0,6]

names = ['ram','sham','rohan','chintu']

mil = (names,Num_List)
print(mil)
print(Num_List[0],names[0])

Num_List.append(3)
print(Num_List)

Num_List.remove(2)
print(Num_List)

Num_List.pop()
print(Num_List)

Num_List.insert(2,8)
print(Num_List)

Num_List.extend([2,18,98,56])
print(Num_List)

del Num_List[3]
print(Num_List)

min(Num_List)
print(min(Num_List))
print(max(Num_List))

Num_List.sort()
print(Num_List)
print(sum(Num_List))



Num_List.clear()
print(Num_List)


#tuple:-
#tuple is also similar to list but it has less features then it.
#it is inmutable.
tuple1 = (22,42,56,78)
print(tuple1[3])

#sets:-
#sets are also like lists where a lot values  can be added printed.
#we cant print index value. 
# it sorts whole list when printed but if same values are putted it removes the duplicate one.
set1 = {22,32,57,86}
print(set1)






#Quiz
# Q. nums = [25,36,95,14,12,26].
#wac to delete values (95,14,12)

#Ans:-

#Solution:- 

nums = [25,36,95,14,12,26]
print(nums)
del nums[2:5]
print(nums)

#Explanation- in this question we were given 6 values in a list and we need to delete values (95,14,12). So as we can see these values index numbers are [2,3,4] respectively,and the index numbers are consecutive.        so we can specify them as[2:5] also, so our final command will be {del nums[2:5]}.
